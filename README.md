# ACM-AI-Task
 To build a simple deep learning model with the dataset provided - Air Quality Annual Summary (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/epa/air-quality)

### Deliverables:

**1. Theoretical analysis of the dataset provided**

The **Air Quality Annual Summary** dataset contains information about air quality measures taken from monitoring stations across the United States. The data is provided by the **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency** and covers a period of several years.

The dataset contains 55 columns and over 1.04 million rows of data. The columns include information about the location of the monitoring station, the type of pollutant being measured, and the results of the measurements taken. Some of the most important columns for analysis might include the *pollutant_standard*, *metric_used*, *method_name*, *arithmetic_mean*, and *arithmetic_standard_dev* columns.

With this dataset, it is possible to conduct a wide range of analyses related to air quality. For example, it might be possible to explore trends in air quality over time, to identify regions or cities with particularly high levels of pollution, or to investigate the impact of specific pollutants on human health.

One potential challenge with the dataset is that it is quite large and contains a lot of information. This means that any analysis will need to carefully consider which columns are most relevant to the research question at hand. It may also be necessary to conduct some data cleaning and processing to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

Overall, the Air Quality Annual Summary dataset is a rich resource for anyone interested in studying air quality in the United States. With careful analysis, it is possible to uncover important insights about pollution trends, human health impacts, and more.
